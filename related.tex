Adobe Story \cite{adobestory2016}, FinalDraft and Celtx are examples of software applications dedicated to script writing. They support collaboration, automatic formatting, navigation and planning for future production, but they treat the script as a text document that is essentially separate from the recordings. In fact, in our preliminary interview of lay and professional audio producers, we found that many of them use general-purpose document editors like Google Docs or Microsoft Word to prepare their scripts.

At the recording and editing stage, Adobe Audition, Avid ProTools, GarageBand and Audacity are among the most popular digital audio workstations (DAWs). These tools allow users to edit audio by manipulating waveforms in a multi-track timeline interface. They also provide a wide variety of low-level signal processing functions. However, since they are designed to serve as general-purpose audio production systems, they include many features that are not directly relevant for creating audio narratives whose main content is speech. Hindenburg Systems develops tools that are specifically targeted for audio narratives. Still, all of these systems are primarily concerned only with the audio and they do not deal with the script directly.   

Recently, several researchers have explored incorporating audio transcripts to support text-based navigation and editing of audio. Whittaker and Amento \cite{whittaker2004semantic} demonstrate that users prefer editing voicemail through its transcript instead of its waveform. Inspired by similar intuition, Casares et al. \cite{casares2002simplifying} and Berthouzoz et al. \cite{berthouzoz2012tools} enable video navigation and editing through time-aligned transcripts. Rubin et al. \cite{rubin2013content} extend this approach to audio narratives. but they focus only on the third step (i.e. editing pre-recorded speech tracks). Our system links and supports all three steps of the production, from script writing to recording and editing, enabling a seamless workflow.
