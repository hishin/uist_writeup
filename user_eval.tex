\section{Informal User Evaluation}
To gauge the utility of our interface, we conducted an informal evaluation with two users. We started each session with a brief demonstration of our interface, and then asked the participants to create an audio recording. We examined their workflow, and the number/type of features they used. We also conducted a post-evaluation interview to gather qualitative feedback. At the end of the session, we solicited written qualitative feedback about our interface. In total, each session lasted about 50 minutes.


We also conducted a pilot study to compare our interface with a state-of-the-art text-based audio editing system \cite{rubin2013content}. We recruited four participants, none of whom had formal audio recording/editing training.
